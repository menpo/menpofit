class AAMBuilder(object):
    r"""
    Class that builds Active Appearance Models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features : `callable` or ``[callable]``, optional
        If list of length ``n_levels``, feature extraction is performed at
        each level after downscaling of the image.
        The first element of the list specifies the features to be extracted at
        the lowest pyramidal level and so on.

        If ``callable`` the specified feature will be applied to the original
        image and pyramid generation will be performed on top of the feature
        image. Also see the `pyramid_on_features` property.

        Note that from our experience, this approach of extracting features
        once and then creating a pyramid on top tends to lead to better
        performing AAMs.

    transform : :map:`PureAlignmentTransform`, optional
        The :map:`PureAlignmentTransform` that will be
        used to warp the images.

    trilist : ``(t, 3)`` `ndarray`, optional
        Triangle list that will be used to build the reference frame. If
        ``None``, defaults to performing Delaunay triangulation on the points.

    diagonal : `int` >= ``20``, optional
        During building an AAM, all images are rescaled to ensure that the
        scale of their landmarks matches the scale of the mean shape.

        If `int`, it ensures that the mean shape is scaled so that the diagonal
        of the bounding box containing it matches the diagonal value.

        If ``None``, the mean shape is not rescaled.

        Note that, because the reference frame is computed from the mean
        landmarks, this kwarg also specifies the diagonal length of the
        reference frame (provided that features computation does not change
        the image size).

    scales : `int` or float` or list of those, optional

    scale_shapes : `boolean`, optional

    scale_features : `boolean`, optional

    max_shape_components : ``None`` or `int` > 0 or ``0`` <= `float` <= ``1`` or list of those, optional
        If list of length ``n_levels``, then a number of shape components is
        defined per level. The first element of the list specifies the number
        of components of the lowest pyramidal level and so on.

        If not a list or a list with length ``1``, then the specified number of
        shape components will be used for all levels.

        Per level:
            If `int`, it specifies the exact number of components to be
            retained.

            If `float`, it specifies the percentage of variance to be retained.

            If ``None``, all the available components are kept
            (100% of variance).

    max_appearance_components : ``None`` or `int` > 0 or ``0`` <= `float` <= ``1`` or list of those, optional
        If list of length ``n_levels``, then a number of appearance components
        is defined per level. The first element of the list specifies the number
        of components of the lowest pyramidal level and so on.

        If not a list or a list with length ``1``, then the specified number of
        appearance components will be used for all levels.

        Per level:
            If `int`, it specifies the exact number of components to be
            retained.

            If `float`, it specifies the percentage of variance to be retained.

            If ``None``, all the available components are kept
            (100% of variance).

    features : `callable` or ``[callable]``, optional

    diagonal : `int` >= ``20``, optional
        During building an AAM, all images are rescaled to ensure that the

        If `int`, it ensures that the mean shape is scaled so that the diagonal

        of components of the lowest pyramidal level and so on.

        If not a list or a list with length ``1``, then the specified number of
        shape components will be used for all levels.

        Per level:
            If `int`, it specifies the exact number of components to be
            retained.

            If `float`, it specifies the percentage of variance to be retained.

            If ``None``, all the available components are kept
            (100% of variance).

    max_appearance_components : ``None`` or `int` > 0 or ``0`` <= `float` <= ``1`` or list of those, optional
        If list of length ``n_levels``, then a number of appearance components
        is defined per level. The first element of the list specifies the number
        of components of the lowest pyramidal level and so on.

        If not a list or a list with length ``1``, then the specified number of
        appearance components will be used for all levels.

        Per level:

class LinearPatchAAMBuilder(AAMBuilder):
    r"""
    Class that builds Linear Patch based Active Appearance Models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patch_shape: (`int`, `int`) or list or list of (`int`, `int`)

    features : `callable` or ``[callable]``, optional
        If list of length ``n_levels``, feature extraction is performed at
        each level after downscaling of the image.
        The first element of the list specifies the features to be extracted at
        the lowest pyramidal level and so on.

        If ``callable`` the specified feature will be applied to the original
        image and pyramid generation will be performed on top of the feature
        image. Also see the `pyramid_on_features` property.

        Note that from our experience, this approach of extracting features
        once and then creating a pyramid on top tends to lead to better
        performing AAMs.

    diagonal : `int` >= ``20``, optional
        During building an AAM, all images are rescaled to ensure that the
        scale of their landmarks matches the scale of the mean shape.

        If `int`, it ensures that the mean shape is scaled so that the diagonal
        of the bounding box containing it matches the diagonal value.

        If ``None``, the mean shape is not rescaled.

        Note that, because the reference frame is computed from the mean
        landmarks, this kwarg also specifies the diagonal length of the
        reference frame (provided that features computation does not change
        the image size).

    scales : `int` or float` or list of those, optional

    scale_shapes : `boolean`, optional

    scale_features : `boolean`, optional

    max_shape_components : ``None`` or `int` > 0 or ``0`` <= `float` <= ``1`` or list of those, optional
        If list of length ``n_levels``, then a number of shape components is
        defined per level. The first element of the list specifies the number
        of components of the lowest pyramidal level and so on.

        If not a list or a list with length ``1``, then the specified number of
        shape components will be used for all levels.

        Per level:
            If `int`, it specifies the exact number of components to be
            retained.

            If `float`, it specifies the percentage of variance to be retained.

            If ``None``, all the available components are kept
            (100% of variance).

    max_appearance_components : ``None`` or `int` > 0 or ``0`` <= `float` <= ``1`` or list of those, optional
        If list of length ``n_levels``, then a number of appearance components
        is defined per level. The first element of the list specifies the number
        of components of the lowest pyramidal level and so on.

        If not a list or a list with length ``1``, then the specified number of
        appearance components will be used for all levels.

        Per level:
            If `int`, it specifies the exact number of components to be
            retained.

            If `float`, it specifies the percentage of variance to be retained.

            If ``None``, all the available components are kept
            (100% of variance).
